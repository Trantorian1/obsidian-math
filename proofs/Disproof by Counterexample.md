> ðŸ“š A **disproof by counter example** is the most trivial of proofs. Given a statement $P$ that is valid for all the elements of the set $S$ it is defined on, it is only required to find an element in $S$ that does not follow $P$ to invalidate $P$.

*ex:*
$$P(x) := \; "every \; positive \; integer \; is \; equal \; to \; the \; sum \; of \; two \; integer \; squares"$$
*disproof:*
	$3 \; is \; not \; equal \; to \; the \; sum \; of \; two\; integer \; squares$
