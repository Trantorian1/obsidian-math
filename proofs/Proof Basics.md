> 📚 A **mathematical proof** is a logical argument that establishes the truth of a mathematical statement beyond *any* doubt.

## Implications

Given a statement $P$ and a statement $Q$, to denote that $P$ *implies* $Q$, we note
$$P \implies Q$$
Which is the same as saying
	*if* $P$ *then* $Q$
	$Q$ *if* $P$
	$P$ only if $Q$

For example
$$x = 2 \implies x^2 < 6$$
> ⚠️ An implication is not reversible, that is to say, if $P \implies Q$, then $Q \centernot\implies P$.

## If and only if

Given a statement $P$ and a statement $Q$, if $P \implies Q$ and $Q \implies P$, then we note
$$P \iff Q$$
Which is the same as saying
	$P$ *if and only if* $Q$

For example
$$x = 4 \iff x^2 = 16$$

> ℹ️ **If and only if** is often abbreviated to **iff**.

## Statement Deduction

> 💡Given a statement $P \implies Q$, it is possible to deduce the following.
$$if\; P \implies Q \; then \; \overline Q \implies \overline P$$
> 💡Given a statement $P \iff Q$, it is possible to deduce the following
$$if \; P \iff Q \; then \; \overline Q \implies \overline P \; and \; \overline P \implies \overline Q, \; s.t \; \overline Q \iff \overline P$$
