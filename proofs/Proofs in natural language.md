Often times, proofs expressed in natural languages can loose their clarity, especially when it comes to relations between logical relations. Here are a few common ways to word logical relations in a way that hopefully makes this less ambiguous.

## Natural language for $P \implies Q$

- *if* $P$ *then* $Q$
- $Q$ *if* $P$
- $P$ *only if* $Q$

> ⚠️ **Do not** mistake $P$ *only if* $Q$ ($P \implies Q$) with $P$ *if and only if* $Q$ ($P \iff Q$)
